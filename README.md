# osbgen
A programming alternative for creating osu! storyboards in Python3.

## Why use this?
The in-game design editor can get the basic job done but doesn't allow for precise control. osbgen provides a way for coding-minded people to create their own storyboards in an object-orientated way. Custom scripts can be made and shared so those who aren't as coding-savvy can still utilize the benefits to create their own storyboards.

## Requirements
* Python3.8+ (Will later on test earlier versions of Python)

### osbpy exists, why remake the wheel?
To be honest, I started this project to gain some personal experience in Python module creation.
